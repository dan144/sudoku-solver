# sudoku-solver

Back in 2012 I was learning Python and had a long plane flight,
so I decided to try and write a Sudoku solver. I spent probably
~6 hours putting this together before landing, so it only solves
using a small number of techniques and does not completely solve
most puzzles.

I tried to finish it later that year, but the code is so confusing
(Pat, I would like to buy a comment) that even I could not figure
out what was going on. I would probably be better off starting from
scratch if I were to revisit this.
